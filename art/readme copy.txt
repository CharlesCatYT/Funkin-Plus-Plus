Thanks for playing FNF (and using this FNF engine, labeled "Funkin++" wow), I guess.

Little info, you have FULL PERMISSION to stream, letsplay, meme, shitpost, mod, do WHATEVER you want with the game.
Use the music in videos you do, use art, ANYTHING. GO CRAZY BRO.

If you do make any sort of video, it would be a bro move if you linked the game and spread the word.

If not, no biggie, we don't fully hate you, just only kinda no biggie.

Oh right, don't forget, this engine is made in Haxe / HaxeFlixel / OpenFL / Lime, so hopefully you know what's in the pretty good taste around this stuff.
Anyway, thanks for reading, and playing. Cheers! {:)
